# Age Calculator
This repo contains project titled Age Calculator in Python completed in July 2020.

#Brief of Project 
This is a project done out of curiosity to calculate the age as per the current date.
For GUI I have used Tkinter.

#Opening the file 
You can run this using cli or terminal with the command 
Go to location where files are stored & run the following code in cmd or terminal 

python ./Pro_Age_Calc.py

You can run this directly by running the Pro_Age_Calc.bat file.

#Usage
The application displays current date.
User has to input date,month & year of birth & then hit Calculate Age Button to get their present age.

If done with everything right,you will get the present age in the format YY years,MM months, DD days.
If any error occurs,it will be shown on the screen.
